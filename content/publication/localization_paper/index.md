abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of ergodicity breaking in geometrically frustrated systems, we study the quench dynamics of interacting hardcore bosons on a sawtooth ladder. We identify a set of initial states for which this system exhibits characteristic signatures of localization like initial state memory retention and slow growth of entanglement entropy for a wide parameter regime. Remarkably, this localization persists even when the many-body spectrum is thermalizing. We argue that the localized dynamics originates from an interaction induced quantum interference. Our results show that the sawtooth ladder can be a fertile platform for realizing non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.

  caption: 'FIG. 3 form the article. (a1)-(a2) Contour plots of the average return probability, P(t), for the 12−site ladder. For (a1), we show the average
of P(t) from t = 0 to t = 1000/J as a function of V and J
0
. In (a2), we show the average of P(t) from t = 0 to t = 1000/V
as a function of J and J
0
. It is clear from these plots that our model exhibits localized dynamics for a wide parameter
regime. (b) Dependence of the localization lifetime, t
∗
on the system size, L, when J
0
/V = −0.4 and J/V = −0.68. We
have defined t
∗
as the time, when P(t) drops below 0.05. The lifetime appears to increase exponentially with the system
size. (c) The overlap of the numerically obtained eigenstate |ψloci with the analytic eigenstate |φloci for the 10−site ladder,
when J/V = J
0
/V . This overlap, F (as defined in Eq. 7) is large (≥ 0.9) for a wide parameter regime, indicating that the
state is localized.'
