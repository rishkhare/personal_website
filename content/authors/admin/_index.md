I am a Senior Scientist at MemComputing, Inc. My research interests include machine learning, optimization and condensed matter physics. 

At MemComputing, we solve your hardest optimization problems using our novel unconventional computing architecture. My work has been focused on using machine learning to analyze high-dimensional data and using statistical tests to increase the efficiency of the MemComputing solver.

Prior to this, I earned my PhD from Purdue University in Physics. My research focused on topics such as ballistic reversible computing, topological computation, and localized dynamics in non-integrable systems. A major part of my thesis was geared towards developing reversible superconducting circuits that can help reduce energy consumption in our computational devices. Prior to moving to the US for my graduate school, I did an integrated BS-MS in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, India where I was awarded the Director’s Gold Medal in Physics. I was also the recipient of the prestigious Ross fellowship at Purdue.
